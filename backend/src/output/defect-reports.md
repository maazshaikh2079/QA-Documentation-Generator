| DETECTED BUILD VERSION |                                                                                                               |
| SUMMARY                | Display refresh rate is not appropriate for real-time monitoring                                                                                                  |
| DESCRIPTION            | The display refresh rate on the TFT screen is inadequate, resulting in a slow update of sensor readings. This makes real-time monitoring difficult and affects the user experience.                                   |
| STEPS TO REPLICATE     | 1. Power on the Water Quality Monitoring System.                                                              |
|                        | 2. Monitor the sensor readings displayed on the TFT screen while values change (simulate by changing the water sample).                                                          |
|                        | 3. Observe the refresh rate of the displayed readings.                                                           |
| ACTUAL RESULTS         | The display refresh rate is slow, and updates to the sensor readings are not displayed in real-time.                                        |
| EXPECTED RESULTS       | The display should refresh at an appropriate rate to provide real-time monitoring of sensor readings.                                              |
| ATTACHMENTS            | NA                                                                                                            |
| REMARKS                | The slow refresh rate impacts the usability of the system and needs to be addressed to provide a better user experience.                                                         |
