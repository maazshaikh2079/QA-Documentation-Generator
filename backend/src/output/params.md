| SUMMARY                | Exit Servo Motor (servo motor2) does not respond to vehicle detection                                                |
| DESCRIPTION            | When a vehicle is detected, the servo motor2 (Exit servo motor) does not change its angle to 90° as expected. This results in a failure to open the exit barrier. |
| STEPS TO REPLICATE     | 1. Ensure the system is running and connected to all sensors and motors. |
|                        | 2. Place a vehicle in the exit sensor detection zone.                    |
|                        | 3. Observe the exit servo motor.                                         |
| ACTUAL RESULTS         | The exit servo motor remains in its default position and does not change its angle to 90° to allow exit. |
| EXPECTED RESULTS       | The exit servo motor should change its angle to 90° when a vehicle is detected at the exit sensor.       |

| DESCRIPTION            | The exit servo motor is not functioning as expected.  It should activate (change its angle to 90°) when the exit sensors detect a vehicle leaving the parking area. |
| STEPS TO REPLICATE      | 1.  Place a vehicle within the detection range of the exit sensors (exit sensor 1 and exit sensor 2).  2.  Ensure both exit sensors are triggered by the vehicle.  3. Observe the exit servo motor. |
| ACTUAL RESULTS         | The exit servo motor remains inactive and does not change its angle to 90° after the exit sensors detect the vehicle.                                               |
| EXPECTED RESULTS       | The exit servo motor should change its angle to 90° when a vehicle is detected by both exit sensors, allowing the vehicle to exit.                                  |
