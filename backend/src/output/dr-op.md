| DETECTED BUILD VERSION |                                                                                                               |
| SUMMARY                | Display refresh rate is not appropriate for real-time monitoring                                                                                                  |
| DESCRIPTION            | The display refresh rate on the TFT screen is inadequate, resulting in a slow update of sensor readings. This makes real-time monitoring difficult and affects the user experience.                                   |
| STEPS TO REPLICATE     | 1. Power on the Water Quality Monitoring System.                                                              |
|                        | 2. Monitor the sensor readings displayed on the TFT screen while values change (simulate by changing the water sample).                                                          |
|                        | 3. Observe the refresh rate of the displayed readings.                                                           |
| ACTUAL RESULTS         | The display refresh rate is slow, and updates to the sensor readings are not displayed in real-time.                                        |
| EXPECTED RESULTS       | The display should refresh at an appropriate rate to provide real-time monitoring of sensor readings.                                              |

| REMARKS                | The slow refresh rate impacts the usability of the system and needs to be addressed to provide a better user experience.                                                         |

| PRODUCT | Social Media Platform |
| RELEASE VERSION |  |
| MODULE | Post Creation & Display |
| DETECTED BUILD VERSION |  |
| SUMMARY | Image Cropping Issue on Mobile Post Creation |
| DESCRIPTION | When creating a new post via the mobile app (Android & iOS), images are unexpectedly cropped, leading to a loss of content and undesirable composition. |
| STEPS TO REPLICATE | 1. Open the Instagram mobile app.  2. Tap the "+" icon to create a new post. 3. Select an image from the device's gallery (portrait or landscape orientation). 4. Observe the image preview in the post creation screen. |
| ACTUAL RESULTS | The selected image is automatically cropped, often focusing on the center of the image, regardless of the user's desired focal point.  Important elements within the image may be cropped out. |
| EXPECTED RESULTS | The selected image should be displayed in its entirety within the post creation screen. The user should have the option to manually crop or adjust the image if desired, but automatic cropping should not occur. |
| ATTACHMENTS | NA |
| REMARKS | This issue impacts user experience, as users cannot share images as intended.  The automatic cropping algorithm appears to be flawed or overly aggressive. |

| DESCRIPTION           | The Fire Hazard Trigger button, when clicked, is not initiating the fire hazard sequence as expected. This is a critical failure that prevents the system from responding to a fire. |
| STEPS TO REPLICATE    | 1. Navigate to the Fire Hazard Page.  2. Locate the Fire Hazard Trigger button.  3. Click the Fire Hazard Trigger button.                                                              |
| ACTUAL RESULTS        | Clicking the Fire Hazard Trigger button does not trigger the fire hazard sequence. No alerts, notifications, or system responses are initiated.                                       |
| EXPECTED RESULTS      | Clicking the Fire Hazard Trigger button should immediately trigger the fire hazard sequence, including activating alarms, sending notifications, and initiating other safety protocols.   |

| SUMMARY               | Inadequate Display Refresh Rate for Real-time Monitoring                                                                                                   |
| DESCRIPTION           | The display refresh rate is not sufficient for real-time monitoring of the water quality parameters. The displayed values appear slow to update, creating a lag between the actual readings and what's shown on the screen. This makes it difficult to observe rapid changes in water quality. |
| STEPS TO REPLICATE     | 1. Power on the Water Quality Monitoring System.<br>2. Immerse the sensors in water samples with varying TDS and turbidity levels.<br>3. Observe the update frequency of TDS, EC, PPM, and NTU values on the TFT screen.<br>4. Quickly change the TDS and turbidity levels of the water sample. <br>5. Observe the display update. |
| ACTUAL RESULTS        | The display refresh rate is slow, causing a noticeable delay in the update of sensor readings on the TFT screen.                                         |
| EXPECTED RESULTS      | The display refresh rate should be fast enough to provide real-time updates of sensor readings, allowing users to observe rapid changes in water quality without significant lag. |

| DESCRIPTION            | The exit servo motor is not functioning as expected.  It should activate (change its angle to 90°) when the exit sensors detect a vehicle leaving the parking area. |
| STEPS TO REPLICATE      | 1.  Place a vehicle within the detection range of the exit sensors (exit sensor 1 and exit sensor 2).  2.  Ensure both exit sensors are triggered by the vehicle.  3. Observe the exit servo motor. |
| ACTUAL RESULTS         | The exit servo motor remains inactive and does not change its angle to 90° after the exit sensors detect the vehicle.                                               |
| EXPECTED RESULTS       | The exit servo motor should change its angle to 90° when a vehicle is detected by both exit sensors, allowing the vehicle to exit.                                  |
